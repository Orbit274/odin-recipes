                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a pan melt down your butter and sauté shallots and garlic. Add in spices and let them bloom/cook for 2 mins</li>
                    <li>Add in your flour and whisk until it's a paste. Turn heat to low. Add in your milk and continue to 
                        whisk until there are no lumps. You want to keep whisking until it thickens slightly, be careful as 
                        this can happen very fast, if it's too thick, add more milk</li>
                    <li>Whisk in Dijon and your cream. And then add in your cream cheese. Season and taste at this point. 
                        Go in with your cheeses but remember to leave some aside to add to the middle/top (maybe 50-70g)</li>
                    <li>Whisk in and then add your cooked macaroni and stir until combined. 
                        Now add half into your baking dish and top with a sprinkle of cheese. 
                        Add the rest and top with more cheese. Bake for 15mins and then grill until bubbly and golden. 
                        Serve with chives on top</li>
                </ol>
